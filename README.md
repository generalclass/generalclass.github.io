# General Class

An initiative to empower general class (aka unreserved) , economically weak people in India who are not entitled to get any government quota/help.

We are committed to work with full dedication to keep building this platform to unite and uplift general class people! 

Please do not use word सवर्ण for ourselves. Political parties in India use this word to create an illusion that we are super-rich and to keep cast based reservation alive forever. The first step to end caste-based reservation is to remove this fictitious label सवर्ण and unite under one name "General Class"!

This platform is completely non political platform. We are committed to work towards our goal with very positive and inclusive approach. Let’s work together to build ‘General Class’ a strong and prosperous community.

General Class is YOUR own platform to bring CHANGE!!
